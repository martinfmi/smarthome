# Eclipse SmartHome Build Instructions

Thanks for your interest in the Eclipse SmartHome project!

Building and running the project is fairly easy if you follow the steps
detailed below.


1. Prerequisites
================

The build infrastructure is based on Maven in order to make it
as easy as possible to get up to speed. If you know Maven already then
there won't be any surprises for you. If you have not worked with Maven
yet, just follow the instructions and everything will miraculously work ;-)

What you need before you start:
- Maven3 from http://maven.apache.org/download.html

Make sure that the "mvn" command is available on your path


2. Checkout
===========

Checkout the source code from GitHub, e.g. by running

git clone https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome.git

3. Building with Maven
======================

To build Eclipse SmartHome from the sources, Maven takes care of everything:
- change into the smarthome directory ("cd smarthome“)
- run "mvn clean install" to compile and package all sources

The build result will be available in the folder 
smarthome/distribution/target. Both the runtime as well as
the designer zips are placed in there.


4. Starting the demo runtime
=======================

- unzip the file eclipsesmarthome-incubation-0.x.0-runtime.zip to a local folder
- launch the runtime with the "start.sh" (resp. "start.bat") script
- check if everything has started correctly: http://localhost:8080/smarthome.app?sitemap=demo


5. Starting the designer
========================

- unzip the file eclipsesmarthome-incubation-0.x.0-designer-<platform>.zip to a local folder
- run the executable „Eclipse-SmartHome-Designer.exe"
